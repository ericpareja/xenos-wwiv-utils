This is Xenos' WWIV 5 InterBBS Last Callers Scripts

This pair of scripts allows your BBS to generate posts and to process message bases for InterBBS Last Caller posts.
The first script is xwibbslastcaller.py.

hello all,

here is my xwibbslastcaller.py script.

you can get it from 
https://github.com/ericpareja/xenos-wwiv-utils/blob/master/xwibbslastcaller.py

if you have problems with it, you can open an issue on github so i can keep
track.

make sure that you have a running python 3 installation.
you may have to change the first line to match your environment's needs.
i can only be sure about linux setups, but it should work on windows with
little modification.

two things you might need to edit in the script are:

sub="IBBSDAT"
bbsaddress="https://wwivbbs.org"

change IBBSDAT to the subtype you want xwibbslastcaller.py to post to. it
will be smart enough to find out what network it is hosted on and who hosts it.

change bbsaddress to your BBS website, or telnet address.

in your wwiv.ini, you should have a LOGON event which can be a batch file or
shell script. 

whatever method you choose, you can add xwibbslastcaller.py to the script
but make sure that xwibbslastcaller.py is called with the full path to DOOR.SYS.
this is the %R passed to the logon.

example entry in WWIV.INI

LOGON_CMD = /home/wwiv/xwibbslastcaller.py %R

for WWIVnet, i started the IBBSDAT sub, hosted @60. this is
Auto-Requestable. it's an experimental sub for "broadcast" data. feel free
to subscribe to it before installing xwibbslastcaller.py

this is part 1 of 2 of the wwivibbslastcaller setup. this script is
reponsible for reading basic info about the caller from DOOR.SYS and posting
a rot47 encoded message to the IBBSDAT sub. on fsxNet, this would be the
FSX_DAT echo area.

part 2 of 2 will follow when i've cleaned it up for general consumption. i'm
having a bit of difficulty making python3 write cp437 characters to a file
properly. my python2 script to do the extraction of data and generate the
laston.txt files is in the github.com repo above.

happy hacking! :)

i pushed an update a while ago. the update makes it even easier to use.
you just add it to your WWIV.INI file or logon batch file with the following
call.

LOGON_CMD = xwibbslastcaller.py %R

this will take care of posting to the appropriate SUBS on WWIVnet or fsxNet.

in the script itself, there are 3 configurable variables:

subs={"IBBSDAT","FSX_DAT"}
bbsaddress="https://wwivbbs.org"
dontshowsl=256

subs contains a list of SUBTYPE (wwivnet) or AREA names (ftn) that the
ibbslastcaller script will post to. if a new BBS network starts using this,
please let me know so i can include it.

bbsaddress is a link to your BBS website or telnet address.

dontshowsl is the SL at which the script will NOT post to any of the subs. by
default, it will post even SYSOP logins. if you don't want this, set the
dontshowsl=255 for sysop to be invisible or 254 for co-sysops and sysops to be
invisible.

 i've completed 2ibbs-extract30 which you can place in your wwiv base directory.
running it will read your configs, determine which subs and networks to read
data from, and write to the appropriate network directories.

you can call it in your script or batch file at least once everytime you want
the laston.txt files to be updated, either after your caller logs off or you
can add it to your logon event.

for testing, you can run it in your WWIV directory.

you can get it here:

2https://github.com/ericpareja/xenos-wwiv-utils/blob/master/ibbs-extract30

on windows, you might have to rename the file to 1ibbs-extract3.py0. let me know
so i can rename it if it's needed.

feedback on this is appreciated.

you'll need these.

1) Install Python 3. You can get it here:

    2https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3111/0

2) Install xenos' xwibbslastcaller.py and ibbs-extract3
   Get them it from here:

    2https://github.com/ericpareja/xenos-wwiv-utils0

3) Subscribe to the IBBSDAT SUB @60.
   Subscribe to the FSX_DAT Echo on fsxNet.

4) Edit xwibbslastcaller.py to suit your needs.
   Edit ibbs-extract3 to suit your needs.

5) In WWIV.INI, add:

    2LOGON_CMD=xwibbslastcaller.py %R0


Note, I don't run Windows so I'm not sure if ibbs-extract3 will run unless you 
rename it to ibbs-extract3.py.

4Instructions for setting up WWIV5IBBSLASTCALLERS0

1) Install Python 3. You can get it here:

    2https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3111/0

2) Install xenos' xwibbslastcaller.py and ibbs-extract3
   Get them from here:

    2https://github.com/ericpareja/xenos-wwiv-utils0

3) Subscribe to the IBBSDAT SUB @60 on WWIVnet.
   Optional: Subscribe to the FSX_DAT Echo on fsxNet.

4) In WWIV.INI, add:

    2LOGON_CMD=xwibbslastcaller.py %R0

5) Also in WWIV.INI, add:

2[wwiv5ibbslastcaller]0
2bbsaddress=https://yourbbsurl.here0
2dontshowsl=2550

If you don't add this section in WWIV.INI, the defaults will be used.
The default URL in bbsaddress is https://wwivbbs.org.
By default, even Sysop and Co-Sysop logins are posted to IBBSDAT. Change the
SL value to the level you want "invisible."  It's up to you what you want. :)

Note, I don't run Windows so I'm not sure if ibbs-extract3 will run unless you
rename it to ibbs-extract3.py.
